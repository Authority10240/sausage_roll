This application doesn have cocoapods installed as it was developed on a windoes machine. Running an IOS version will require cocoapods to be installed .

##To run the application on android run the following commands on your ide terminal
flutter clean
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-confilcting-outpus.

The app is still in development, but you will find that the app is developed in the full clean architecture with bloc used for state managent, i have incorporated bloc and unit testing for datasources and bloc level of the app this far due to time constraints.

hioe you find everything in order and i hope this affords me the opportunity of working with you.
